# acreage-calculator-triangle-lot
A program that calculates the acreage of a triangular lot.

## Requirements
- Ask user to input Side A (base) and Side B (height) of a triangular lot.
- Determine the acreage.
- Inform the user of the following output:
  - the length of Side C (hypotenuse)
  - the total acreage
- Use Input and Output methods.

## Notes
- An acre of land = 43,560 sqft and cannot be changed.
- Area of a right triangle is 1/2(base*height).
- Use Pythagorean Theorem (PT) to determine hypotenuse.
- PT is a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup>
- Utilize Java Math class methods (sqrt and pow).
