# acreage-calculator-triangle-lot
A program that calculates the acreage of a triangular lot.

## Requirements
- ask user to input Side A (base) and Side B (height) of a triangular lot
- determine the acreage
- inform the user of the following output:
- - the length of Side C (hypotenuse)
- - the total acreage
- use Input and Output methods

## Notes
- an acre of land = 43,560 sqft and cannot be changed
- area of a right triangle is 1/2(base*height)
- use Pythagorean Theorem (PT) to determine hypotenuse
- PT is a^2 + b^2 = c^2
- utilize Java Math class methods (sqrt and pow)
